# Notes

Look at [site on Move Constructors](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/c-rvalue-references-and-move-semantics-beginners).

[Copy and Swap](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom/3279550#3279550): Avoids repeating yourself (DRY) in the copy assignment operator (and I assume may be applicable to move-assignment). Also more exception safe.
